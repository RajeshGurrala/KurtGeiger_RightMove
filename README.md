# KurtGeiger_RightMove
INRO-
The project is supplied as a zip file. upon zipping the project all the dependencies are installed automatically when the IDE indexes. Recommended IDE for the
project is Intellij. even after the project is indexed the error message "path to git executable not valid" would still appear. however, the project could still be run
in spite of this.

PROJECT STRUCTURE
Under the SRC lies 2 directories; I) main and II) test

I) main has Pages and Support packages. Pages house all the classes that pertain to web pages of the particular project
the Support has 3 classes 1) BaseClass, 2) ElementUtils and 3) WebModel

1)BaseClass has @Before and @After methods that run before and after each scenario. @Before has methods to open the browser,
expand it and pass the url. the url comes from config.properties file that lies under text/resources. at the moment the url is for the RightMove feature.
 to run the kurtGeiger feature, replace the url in .getProperties method.
 @After has methods that capture a screenshot upon scenario failure. it also has methods to tear down the browser after each scenario execution.

2) ElementUtils houses all the custom written generic methods such as click, sendKeys, switchBrowser etc. the ElementUtils class
has getProperty method that fetches data from the config.properties file based on the key-value pattern. the browser to execute the tests on
 is also supplied from here. prominent methods such as captureScreenShot, ScrollToElement, JAVAExecutorCLick are all housed here.

3) WebModel class has objects created for all the classes in Pages and Support packages and are called via return type methods

II) test has 1) JAVA and 2) Resources

1) has Step definitions to the featureFiles. RunnerTest (the main trigger to fire up the tests) lies here. Tests could be
cherry picked based on the tags provided in the RunnerTest class.
2) Resources has feature files and config.properties file. KurtGeiger feature starts with the KG and the RightMove feature starts with te word RightMove

REPORT GENERATION
extant reports are generated under the output directory that lies on the top of the src. upon test execution a .html file is created
 which could be opened in any browser of choice. the report look quite similar to the JENKINS generated Cucumber reports.
 the .png format screenShots captured upon scenario failure are also stored here.

TEST EXECUTION
To execute tests replace the desired url in the @Before and right click the corresponding feature file and run.
feature files could also be run based on the tags in RunnerTest class. at the moment tags are at the featureFile level,
however these could be assigned to individual scenarios.
